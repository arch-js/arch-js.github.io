{"name":"Arch","tagline":"Web application framework for React.","body":"## About\r\n\r\nArch is a single page web application framework using React as its\r\nUI layer. Arch takes a functional style approach with central immutable state\r\narchitecture inspired by [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om).\r\n\r\nArch applications are written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net)\r\nby default (read more about [the reasoning](docs/07-livescript.md)\r\nbehind the decision), they are fully isomorphic out of the box and\r\nArch comes with it's own Node.js based server, Webpack bundler\r\nand a CLI to help you get started.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nFor example code, see [demos from the introduction talk](http://github.com/charypar/arch-talk)\r\nat London React Meetup.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\nStart by installing the Arch CLI\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g arch-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create a directory for your new application and go inside\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir my-app && cd my-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then generate a new app by running\r\n\r\n```\r\narch-cli init\r\n```\r\n\r\nand following the steps. When done start the application by running\r\n\r\n```\r\narch-cli serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nyour application is now running on <http://localhost:3000>.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nArch doesn't have a website yet, but you can [read the\r\ndocumentation](docs/) (which is mostly complete)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
