# About
Arch is a single page web application framework using React as its UI layer. Arch takes a functional style approach with central immutable state architecture inspired by [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om).

Arch applications are written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net) by default (read more about [the reasoning](docs/07-livescript.md) behind the decision), they are fully isomorphic out of the box and Arch comes with it's own Node.js based server, Webpack bundler and a CLI to help you get started.

# Examples
For example code, see [demos from the introduction talk](http://github.com/charypar/arch-talk) at London React Meetup.

# Get Started
Start by installing the Arch CLI

```
$ npm install -g arch-cli
```

Then create a directory for your new application and go inside

```
$ mkdir my-app && cd my-app
```

You can then generate a new app by running

```
arch-cli init
```

and following the steps. When done start the application by running

```
arch-cli serve
```

your application is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
