# Application as Data
The main change in the approach React takes to building user interfaces is how it handles the data your UI is rendering. You start building your interface from a static markup. Then you decide which aspects of the content you need to control from outside of the component (`props`) and finally you add interaction by letting some of the data change (by abstracting it into the `state`). Your user interface thus becomes a projection of a data structure composed of the `props` and the `state`. Your UI is a function of the `props` and `state`.

Arch takes this approach and scales it beyond a single component, while making it look, if you squint a little, as if nothing changed for the components themselves. When you need to share some data between two components, you can promote it onto the shared central app-state and pass a cursor to both components in `props`. Components are also allowed to modify the data they've got in props and Arch propagates the updates to the rest of the application.

In Arch, your whole UI is a functional projection of the app-state (plus the current URL). Think of that again, your _entire_ user interface state is described by a single data structure. For the components, though, everything still feels like simple, local data.

When taking this approach, you'll find the central app-state becomes a simple data model of your _user interface_ (not your application data!). Instead of starting from the markup, you can start from a minimal description of your user interface as a data structure and how the different modes will be represented. This model becomes the foundation of your entire application (and looking at it should reveal a lot of the intent you had building it and its general function).

For example, here is what a blog app-state could look like when on the listing page:

```livescript
articles:
  loading: false
  total: 8
  items:
    * title: My first blog
      published: Date
      abstract: This is the first blog on my website
      comments: 1
    * title: Loving Arch so far
      published: Date
      abstract: Building applications in Arch is so easy!
      comments: 6
    * ...
article:
  loading: false
  content: null
tags:
  javascript: 5
  arch: 3
  react: 7
  ...
```

and so on. Looking at the data structure makes it quite clear what the application is all about. A chat application would look very different from a news site or a customer database. It also makes it easy to see what the application is doing at this point in time.

## Benefits of the central state
This makes a lot of things very simple. Reproducing any problem, for instance, is a matter of rendering the application with the problematic app-state. By being, in essence, a simple (albeit fairly big) data structure, you don't have any code dependencies between your domain model and your UI code - only data structure dependencies.

The other important aspect of the Arch app-state is that it is backed by an immutable data structure, ensuring that whenever you `.deref!` a cursor, the data you get back is yours and yours only. It can never change in your hands. No need to ever again try to track down some innocent looking write to a function argument causing a bug at the other end of your application.

Finally, making your entire UI state a single data structure, you can do many things you cannot do with a state spread across multiple places encapsulated inside object instances.

You can, for example, record every state of the app-state over time (which is fairly cheap again thanks to being backed by an immutable data structure which employs structural sharing) and get a very crude undo functionality almost for free. It is entirely possible to record the full user session this way making reproduction of issues dead simple - you can just replay the app-state and watch the application get into an unexpected state. You can also very easily persist your application state to restore it later or even send it somewhere.

## Simple data beats domain model objects every time
All of the above is made possible by using plain data model, rather than objects with methods, to back your user interface. By making the state observable at the same time, you achieve complete decoupling of your UI from your business logic through the state. As long as you keep the produced and expected data structures the same, you can swap state observers or even run multiple ones at the same time.

Instead of manipulating the DOM in response to user actions and other events, you can manipulate a simple, concise data structure describing your application's state which is much simpler, easier to reason about and side-effect free. You also use the state to mediate communication between parts of your application in a simple observable fashion.

Finally, you keep all of the (interesting) state in your application in a single place, making all of your other code state-less, i.e. purely functional. The simplification brought by this separation cannot be overstated. Having all state on one side and all logic state-less is easier to keep track of, reason about, test manually and automatically, persist and restore, even construct your application's state artificially.

## Complete state, not complete data
One thing to note is that having your entire application state in the single data structure doesn't mean having all of your application data (i.e. the entire possible state space) in it at the same time. Your app-state only needs to contain as much data at the time as you plan to present to the user.

Arguably the limits of how much a human can take in from the screen are much lower than the technical limits to the amount of data the JavaScript runtime and your application as a whole can handle at any one time. Much of the focus on handling data in larger applications will be in getting the right data into the app-state at the right time and recent technologies like Facebook's Relay and Graph API should help with that.
